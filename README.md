Hello Everyone!! 	:dizzy:

The aim of the project is to evaluate the sales of the games and to conduct a sentimental study on the comments given by the gamers and the critics . 

The study is divided into several steps: 


 ## I- Preprocessing vgsales :

This phase consists of preprocessing the vgsales file and analyzing the correlations between the variables. 

## II- Webscrapping metascores : 

the site used for scrapping metascore scores (video game scores)
is the following one :
https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered

All the steps are explained in the following file (WEBSCRAPPING / VGSALES / METASCORE / MATACRITIC.COM
) ;  the library used is Beautiful Soup

## III- Webscrapping user and critic reviews : 

For this part of webscrapping, the library used remains beautiful soup and all the steps are available in the file 
(Gaming_analyst/Preprocessing metagames - scrapping user review & critic review.ipynb)


## IV- Sentiment analysis / Text mining on comments :

This part of the study aims to analyze the scrapped comments.
We have created two types of feelings: 0 and 1 with a condition rule:
if the user score > 6 : positive feeling

if the critical score > 60 : positive feeling 

From the positive and negative feelings of the users and critics, we analyze the occurrence of the words that come up the most often and get out the success criteria of a game
